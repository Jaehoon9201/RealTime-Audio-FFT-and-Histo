## RealTimeAudio-FFT-SPECGRAM-AQ.py
It's a newly updated code from the below file(RealTime-Audio-FFT-and-Specgram).
It's also based on the [Reference](https://github.com/markjay4k/Audio-Spectrum-Analyzer-in-Python).

### what is different with below one
:bulb: More optimized. It shows the data acquired during 2 seconds.
:bulb: It saves the audio file obtained during 2 seconds. It also makes a list of the saved files.
